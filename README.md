# Contributor Hub

Welcome to the Contributor Hub! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is designed to help people make their **first contribution** to open source. The goal is simple: add your favorite quote to the `quotes.md` file. It's a great way to learn the basics of Git and GitHub in a friendly and low-pressure environment.

## How to Contribute

Follow these simple steps to add your quote:

1.  **Fork this repository.** Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account.
2.  **Edit the `quotes.md` file.** Open the `quotes.md` file in your forked repository and add your favorite quote to the list.

    ```markdown
    > "The best way to keep a prisoner from escaping is to make sure he never knows he's in prison." â€“ Fyodor Dostoevsky
    ```

    Add your quote below the existing ones.
3.  **Commit your changes.** Once you've added your quote, scroll to the bottom of the page and add a descriptive commit message (e.g., "Add my favorite quote"). Then, click the "Commit changes" button.
4.  **Create a Pull Request.** Go to the main page of your forked repository. You'll see a "Contribute" button. Click it and then select "Open a pull request."
5.  **Submit your Pull Request.** Review your changes and add a title and optional description to your pull request. Then, click the "Create pull request" button.

That's it! I'll review your pull request, and if everything looks good, I'll merge it into the main repository. You'll officially be a contributor! ðŸŽ‰
